# Open_Address_Collision
C Program For Open Address Collision

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

This Is A C-Program To Illustrate Open Addressing Collision

Open addressing also called closed hashing is a method of resolving collisions by probing , or searching through alternate locations in the array until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table.
